I am a founding researcher at [99andBeyond](https://99andbeyond.com), working on novel learning algorithms for 
de novo drug design. Checkout our latest groundbreaking work, accepted at ICML2020 - 
[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12485)]
[[blog](https://99andbeyond.com/blog.html)]

Prior to joining 99andBeyond, I finished my Masters (by research) at
[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) / Université de Montréal 
(supervised by Prof. Liam Paull).
My thesis was focused on novel learning algorithms for active localization.
I am grateful for support from Mila, Université de Montréal, Arbour Foundation.

My current research interests broadly span over machine learning,
reinforcement learning, drug discovery and robotics.

When I am not doing research, I play chess (I recently became an [International Master](https://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=5028280)) and read.
