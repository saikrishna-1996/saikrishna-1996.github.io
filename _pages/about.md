Sai Krishna is currently working as a reinforcement learning researcher at 
[AI-Redefined](https://ai-r.com) that 
pioneers in human-in-the-loop training and other AI technologies. In his previous role, Sai 
developed the world's first RL based synthesizable drug discovery platform and has widely 
published his work in top AI conferences like ICML, AAAI, NeurIPS (Oral at DRL workshop). 
While he was a MSc (research) student in AI at REAL lab in Mila (Quebec AI institute), UdeM, 
he developed deep active localization that was published in the top robotics journal: RA-L. 
He also contributed to the Maplite project and his team (based in MIT) won the best paper 
award at RA-L. He was supported by complete tuition fee wavier, research stipend ($44K for 2 years) 
and Arbour foundation scholarship ($10K). His other research interests include drug discovery 
and quantum computing. He is also an International Master in chess and most recently won the 
Canadian University Chess Championship. 

I am a founding researcher / head ML researcher at [99andBeyond](https://99andbeyond.com), working on novel learning algorithms for 
de novo drug design. Checkout our latest groundbreaking work, accepted at ICML2020 - 
[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12485)]
[[blog](https://99andbeyond.com/blog.html)]

I developed novel RL algorithms (in collaboration with researchers from Mila, AMII, MIT etc..)
that solved the long standing challenges of large discrete 
action space (ICML'20), multiple action types (AAAI'21), and optimizing for the maximum
reward objective (NeurIPS'20 DRL workshop).


Prior to joining 99andBeyond, I finished my Masters (by research) at
[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) / Université de Montréal 
(supervised by Prof. Liam Paull).
My thesis was focused on novel learning algorithms for active localization.
I am grateful for the support from Mila, DIRO, Université de Montréal, Arbour Foundation.

My current research interests broadly span over machine learning,
reinforcement learning, drug discovery, robotics and quantum computing.
When I am not doing research, I play chess (I recently became an [International Master](https://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=5028280)) and read.
