WARNING: This webpage is probably NOT up to date.

I am a founding researcher / head ML researcher at [99andBeyond](https://99andbeyond.com), working on novel learning algorithms for 
de novo drug design. Checkout our latest groundbreaking work, accepted at ICML2020 - 
[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12485)]
[[blog](https://99andbeyond.com/blog.html)]

I developed novel RL algorithms (in collaboration with researchers from Mila, AMII, MIT etc..)
that solved the long standing challenges of large discrete 
action space (ICML'20), multiple action types (AAAI'21), and optimizing for the maximum
reward objective (NeurIPS'20 DRL workshop).


Prior to joining 99andBeyond, I finished my Masters (by research) at
[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) / Université de Montréal 
(supervised by Prof. Liam Paull).
My thesis was focused on novel learning algorithms for active localization.
I am grateful for the support from Mila, DIRO, Université de Montréal, Arbour Foundation.

My current research interests broadly span over machine learning,
reinforcement learning, drug discovery, robotics and quantum computing.
When I am not doing research, I play chess (I recently became an [International Master](https://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=5028280)) and read.
