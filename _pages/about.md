I am working at a stealth mode start-up. More details will follow. 

I finished my Masters (by research) at Montreal Institute For Learning Algorithms (MILA), advised by Dr. Liam Paull. 

I work mostly in the areas of Reinforcement Learning. During my undergrad, I worked in computer vision and deep learning for robotics. My other interests include causality, cognitive AI etc..

When I am not doing research, I play chess (I recently became an International Master and won many International medals when I was a kid) and read physics.

I am lazy. So, this webpage is probably outdated.
