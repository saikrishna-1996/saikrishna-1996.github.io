I am a final year Masters (by research) student at Montreal Institute For Learning Algorithms (MILA), advised by Dr. Liam Paull. I am graduating in July 2019 (I think so)

I work in the areas of Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. During my undergrad, I worked in computer vision and deep learning for robotics. The culture at Mila made me delve deep into various topics like theory of Reinforcement Learning, biologically plausible learning algorithms, generative models etc.. 

When I am not doing research, I play chess (I recently became an International Master and won many International medals when I was a kid) and read physics
