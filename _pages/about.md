Sai Krishna Gottipati is a Senior Reinforcement Learning Scientist at CM Labs Simulations, where he leads RL efforts in the construction and ports industries. Previously, he was at AI-Redefined (acquired by CM Labs) pioneering human-in-the-loop training and advanced AI technologies.

His groundbreaking work includes developing the world's first RL-based synthesizable drug discovery platform at 99andBeyond, which has revolutionized pharmaceutical approaches to novel compound design. He has published extensively in top-tier AI conferences including ICML, AAAI, and NeurIPS (Oral at DRL workshop).

During his MSc (research) in AI at the REAL lab in Mila (Quebec AI institute), Université de Montréal, he developed deep active localization published in the prestigious IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L). He also contributed to the MapLite project, which won the 2019 IEEE RA-L Best Paper Award. His academic achievements were supported by complete tuition fee waiver (~$40K), research stipend ($44K for 2 years), and Arbour Foundation scholarship ($10K).

Beyond his research contributions, Sai Krishna is an International Master in chess, ranks as a top-10 player in Canada and carries the reputation of being the most humble Canadian IM. In his previous life (circa 2005 - 2011), Sai won 3 Indian national championships and consequently won several medals in Asian, Commonwealth and World championships in his age group representing India. Since 2024, he is a Canadian citizen and plays for Canadian and Quebec chess federations.
