I am a founding researcher at [99andBeyond](https://99andbeyond.com), researching of novel learning algorithms for 
de novo drug design. Checkout our latest groundbreaking work, accepted at ICML2020 - 
[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12485)]
[[blog](https://99andbeyond.com/blog.html)]

I finished my Masters (by research) at Montreal Institute For Learning Algorithms (MILA), advised by Dr. Liam Paull. 

I work mostly in the areas of Reinforcement Learning. During my undergrad, I worked in computer vision and deep learning for robotics. My other interests include causality, cognitive AI etc..

When I am not doing research, I play chess (I recently became an International Master and won many International medals when I was a kid) and read physics.

I am lazy. So, this webpage is probably outdated.
