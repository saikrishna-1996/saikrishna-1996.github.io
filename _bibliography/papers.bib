  abstract = {We present an approach for reconstructing vehicles from a single (RGB) image, in the context of autonomous driving. Though the problem appears to be ill-posed, we demonstrate that prior knowledge about how 3D shapes of vehicles project to an image can be used to reason about the reverse process, i.e., how shapes (back-)project from 2D to 3D. We encode this knowledge in shape priors, which are learnt over a small keypoint-annotated dataset. We then formulate a shape-aware adjustment problem that uses the learnt shape priors to recover the 3D pose and shape of a query object from an image. For shape representation and inference, we leverage recent successes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the task of object and keypoint localization, and train a novel cascaded fully-convolutional architecture to localize vehicle keypoints in images. The shape-aware adjustment then robustly recovers shape (3D locations of the detected keypoints) while simultaneously filling in occluded keypoints. To tackle estimation errors incurred due to erroneously detected keypoints, we use an Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) scheme for robust optimization, and as a by-product characterize noise models for each predicted keypoint. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving benchmarks, and present superior results to existing monocular, as well as stereo approaches. },

  abstract = {Active localization is the problem of generating robot actions that allow it to maximally disambiguate its pose within a reference map. Traditional approaches to this use an information-theoretic criterion for action selection and hand-crafted perceptual models. In this work we propose an end-to-end differentiable method for learning to take informative actions that is trainable entirely in simulation and then transferable to real robot hardware with zero refinement. The system is composed of two modules: a convolutional neural network for perception, and a deep reinforcement learned planning module. We introduce a multi-scale approach to the learned perceptual model since the accuracy needed to perform action selection with reinforcement learning is much less than the accuracy needed for robot control. We demonstrate that the resulting system outperforms using the traditional approach for either perception or planning. We also demonstrate our approaches robustness to different map configurations and other nuisance parameters through the use of domain randomization in training. The code is also compatible with the OpenAI gym framework, as well as the Gazebo simulator.},

  abstract={An almost-perfect chess playing agent has been a long standing challenge in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Some of the recent advances demonstrate we are approaching that goal. In this project, we provide methods for faster training of self-play style algorithms, mathematical details of the algorithm used, various potential future directions, and discuss most of the relevant work in the area of computer chess. Deep Pepper uses embedded knowledge to accelerate the training of the chess engine over a "tabula rasa" system such as Alpha Zero. We also release our code to promote further research.},
